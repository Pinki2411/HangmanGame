# HangmanGame
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game begins with a word chosen at random, and the player can only see the number of letters in the word, represented by blank spaces. Each time the player guesses a correct letter, it is revealed in the word. However, for each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure ("the hangman") is drawn. The goal is to guess the entire word before the hangman drawing is completed. It's a fun way to test vocabulary and spelling skills while adding an element of suspense and strategy.
